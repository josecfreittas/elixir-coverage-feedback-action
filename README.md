# Elixir coverage feedback comment

This action gets the output of `mix test --cover`, treats it, and creates a feedback message in the pull request of origin. It also checks if the coverage reaches the minimum configured in the action, and exits with an error if it doesn't.

By default, this action assumes that you are using Elixir's default coverage tool. However, it also supports [ExCoveralls](https://github.com/parroty/excoveralls), and if you prefer it, simply add the `coverage_tool` configuration inside the `with` option that specifies it.

Additionally, this action supports setting a `working_directory` in the with configuration if your Elixir project is not at the root of the repository.
