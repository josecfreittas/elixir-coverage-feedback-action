# Elixir coverage feedback comment

This action gets the output of `mix test --cover`, treats it, and creates a feedback message in the pull request of origin. It also checks if the coverage reaches the minimum configured in the action, and exits with an error if it doesn't.

By default, this action assumes that you are using the Elixir's default coverage tool. But it also supports [ExCoveralls](https://github.com/parroty/excoveralls), and if you preferes it, just add the `coverage_tool` configuration inside the `with` option specifying it.
